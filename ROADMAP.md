# Roadmap

## Now (0-2 weeks)
- Stabilize overlay flow: eliminate accidental actions, ensure input focus safety, and reduce friction to recover.
- Improve activity-to-goal matching clarity: show why an activity is considered off-task.
- Add lightweight tests around overlay actions and input behavior.

## Next (2-6 weeks)
- Calibrate intervention intensity by streak risk and recent context.
- Introduce adaptive nudges (tone + timing) based on user response history.
- Add a simple “why this matters” panel tied to the user’s goal statement.

## Later (6-12 weeks)
- Multimodal coaching: combine overlay, voice, and quick micro-plans.
- Personalization layer with explainable rules (no black-box scoring).
- Weekly coaching summary with habit loop insights and next-step experiments.

## Ongoing principles
- Protect privacy and consent; minimize data retention and visibility.
- Keep changes small, measurable, and reversible.
